Although it allows for timely responses, the threshold for asking questions is too low. Questioners often need the respondent&#39;s progressive guidance to clarify their questions, which wastes a lot of time.</p></li><li><p>Private chat messages on QQ are not timely and often interrupt the respondent&#39;s current work process. In contrast, GitHub issues can be handled in a unified manner, saving more time.</p></li><li><p>Other users cannot participate in answering questions through private chat on QQ, and others cannot see the questions and answers.
