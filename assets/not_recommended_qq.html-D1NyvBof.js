There are often repetitive questions, which do not benefit the project.</p></li><li><p>The efficiency of communication on QQ is actually quite low. Although it allows for timely responses, the threshold for asking questions is too low. Questioners often need the respondent&#39;s progressive guidance to clarify their questions, which wastes a lot of time.</p></li><li><p>Private chat messages on QQ are not timely and often interrupt the respondent&#39;s current work process. In contrast, GitHub issues can be handled in a unified manner, saving more time.</p></li><li><p>Other users cannot participate in answering questions through private chat on QQ, and others cannot see the questions and answers. This is not conducive to divergent thinking and knowledge dissemination.</p></li></ol><h2 id="private-chat-for-technical-consultations-is-generally-only-accepted-from-the-following-individuals-with-selfless-friendship-relationships" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#private-chat-for-technical-consultations-is-generally-only-accepted-from-the-following-individuals-with-selfless-friendship-relationships" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Private chat for technical consultations is generally only accepted from the following individuals with selfless friendship relationships:</h2><ol><li>Those who have submitted pull requests or other forms of code contributions.</li><li>Those who have open-sourced projects based on ZLMediaKit.</li><li>Those who have actively answered related technical questions in QQ groups or issues.</li><li>Those who have shared self-written ZLMediaKit-related documents.</li><li>Those who have sponsored the ZLMediaKit project or the author.</li><li>Those who have made any contributions to the development and promotion of ZLMediaKit.</li></ol>',4),a=[s];function r(h,l){return i(),t("div",null,a)}const p=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","not_recommended_qq.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
